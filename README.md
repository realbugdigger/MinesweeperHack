# Minesweeper Hack

This game is small enough not to be overwhelming, yet complex enough to make it a fun challenge.
While there are definitely easier ways to crack this code, I've chosen a learn-as-I-go approach which might not be the quickest, but undoubtedly helps me delve deeper into the essence of reverse engineering.

When we open the game we can see that it consists of a minefield. 
The way I would program this game is to make minefield as a matrix and obviously mines should be loaded at random fields everytime we start a game.
So I am going to start with that assumption.
